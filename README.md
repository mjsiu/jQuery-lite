#jQuery Lite

jQuery Lite is a project that attempts to rebuild some of the core functionality of jQuery.

Using the API documentation from both the [native DOM][native DOM] and [jQuery][jQuery], core functionality was rewritten using vanilla javascript. The goal was to create a light-weight jQuery library for personal use, as well as a learning process to fully understand how jQuery works.
